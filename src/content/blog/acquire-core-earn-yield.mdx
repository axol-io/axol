Bridge your favorite asset onto the Core Chain. For this example, we will use USDC on Optimism. You can choose from 5 other popular networks. For transaction featured below you’ll need USDC (on Optimism network) and a small amount of ETH (on Optimism network) to pay for the transaction fee:

<br/>

Now that you have USDC on the Core network go to SushiSwap to swap $USCD (Core) to $CORE (Core). Connect to Core Blockchain by searching networks on the top right and then complete the MetaMask prompts to swap.
